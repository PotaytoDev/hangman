# hangman
Basic command line implementation of the classic game of hangman - from The
Odin Project curriculum.

This project will be the first game project where I implement reading from a
file. Additionally, this is the first time that I will be serializing objects
and writing them to a file to save the state of the game during any of the
player's turns and allow the player to load a game from any of the saved states.

The google-10000-english-no-swears.txt file used in this project was acquired
from the first20hours GitHub repository found at:
